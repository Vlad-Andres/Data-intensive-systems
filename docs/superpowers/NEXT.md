# NEXT — Live Hand-off

- **Iteration 4: complete and merged.** `playground-portal` `main` is at `3e56fac`: packages A (#4), B (#5), C+D (#6), the README (`b11f465`) and admin translation editing (#7, `/admin/translations`).
- **Iteration 4 verification:** lint, tests and build green; the E1 flow, header, 375 px and console checks are recorded in [`plans/iter-4/package-E.md`](plans/iter-4/package-E.md).
- **Known issue (course pages):** in production each course page logs one console error because the template registers a service worker (`/sw.js`) the portal does not serve. Fix in `playground-template` (`SiteShell`), then `npm run sync:core`. Waiting for the owner's go-ahead.
- **Not tested yet:** a real model run (the model account has no credit); test once it is topped up.

## Iteration 5 (merged, owner testing)

- **Merged to production:** P (PR #8), the course service-worker fix (PR #9), and A–E (PR #10, `a02e044`). Template: branch `iteration-5` at `c8fe480`, vendored into the portal.
- **What was checked (2026-11-12, fake model only):** portal 162 tests and template 450 tests pass; CI green. A scripted whole-flow run passed 37/37: guest flow and guest limit, every marker, language decisions, kept files on/off at creation, refine (summary, version, lock, refine-empty, concurrency, round limit), append, the append-or-reorganise choice both ways, another user and guests locked out, an old `plan`-step job. By hand in the browser: claim, restore, kept files off, delete a course, delete an account, design screen in EN/RO at 375 px, building from an alternative. Production build: course pages may be framed only by the portal (`frame-ancestors 'self'`), portal pages `'none'`; dev sign-in is 404 in production.
- **Found and fixed during the check:** "keep my files" at creation was rejected by the request schema; the local file store could be read half-written by two job drivers; the level was not translated on the design screen.
- **Not checked (stopped at the owner's request, who tests it):** console/CSP errors in a browser on the production build, a `[custom]` exercise in the sandbox after these changes, dark mode on a course, real Google sign-in, and any real-model run (the model has no credit). The content-fit rubric for real runs is in [`notes/2026-11-content-fit-rubric.md`](notes/2026-11-content-fit-rubric.md).
- **Owner actions:** create the Google OAuth client (redirect `https://playground-portal-bay.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`) and set `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET` (32+ chars) in Vercel Production, then redeploy. Until then accounts stay off and the portal behaves as in iteration 4.
- **Next:** the owner's testing; after that, a real-model run on the five fixtures (at most 5 runs, with the owner's go-ahead) scored with the rubric.
- **Note:** the owner's opencode agent has temporary worktrees on both `iteration-5` branches that are now behind; delete them before reusing that agent.
