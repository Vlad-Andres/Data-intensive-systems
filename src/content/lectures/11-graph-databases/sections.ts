Schema triples live in the same table, so a *direct* sub-class is easy to find but sub-class in general means combining many triples.\n\n**Graph schema – vertical data** (RDFSuite) exploits RDF Schema: tables Class, Property (with domain and range), SubClass and SubProperty, a hard-coded Type table for built-ins, and data tables **Instance**(URI, classid) and **PropertyInstance**(from, name, to). In the example below, a Truck (100) and a Car (200) with brand, privateLicence and businessLicence. A variant uses one table per class and per property (brand, privateLicence, businessLicence…).\n\n**Property table.** Cluster properties that most resources share — type, title and year — into the columns of one table; resource 4 gets NULL for year. Everything else goes into an **excess table** with the vertical layout. *The article titled LAURIN from 2001* is then a single selection. **Multi-valued** properties (author) cannot be columns in first normal form and always land in the excess table. Variants: several property tables (journal and file always appear together), or **class property tables**, one per RDFS class (Article, Book) — where a shared property such as title appears in several tables and *all years* becomes a UNION.\n\n**Vertical partitioning** is the column-store idea: one table per predicate, k tables for k properties. URIs are keys only for single-valued properties, so indexes on the URI columns are needed; sorted by URI, tables merge-join efficiently and the values of a multi-valued property sit together.\n\n**Smart indexing** targets exploratory queries on heterogeneous data. A triple's three parts can be combined in 3! = **6 orders**; for each order (say subject–predicate–object) build a list of subjects, each pointing to a list of its predicates, each pointing to the list of objects — see the diagram below. The object lists of s-p-o and p-s-o are the same, so they are stored once. In relational form this needs two-column tables for the first two levels and single-column tables for the last. **RDF-3X** builds the same six indexes from scratch, compresses them and adds aggregate indexes.",

A transaction is an **in-memory object** holding its writes, backed by a **lock manager** that write-locks the nodes and relationships it touches. On commit the changes are appended to a **write-ahead log**; once the commit entry is flushed to disk they are durable, are applied to the graph, and the locks are released. On rollback the object is discarded and the locks released. Concurrent changes to the same elements are serialised, with deadlock detection. From a non-shell client every query is a transaction; in the shell, :begin and :commit group statements.\n\n**Recoverability.** After an unclean shutdown Neo4j **replays** the most recent transaction log. Replaying is **idempotent**, so transactions already applied do no harm, and the store ends up consistent with everything committed before the failure. In a cluster a recovered instance then asks the master for newer transactions and catches up.",

    md: "**Availability.** Neo4j clusters are **master-slave**, with a **complete replica** of the graph on every machine. Writes go to the master and are replicated to the slaves at frequent intervals; some slaves may lag behind by milliseconds. The classic topology is **write-master, read-slaves**: writes scale only up to one machine, reads almost linearly. Neo4j also allows **writing through slaves**: the slave first catches up with the master, then commits synchronously on both — durable on two instances, at the cost of write latency; every write still passes through the master. **Graph-local**, idiomatic queries that start from a few significant nodes spread the load, use the caches well and reduce contention.\n\n**HA cluster** (*Seven Databases in Seven Weeks*, High Availability). HA mode is Neo4j's answer to *can a graph database scale?* — yes, with caveats. As in MongoDB the servers **elect a master** that is responsible for data distribution; unlike MongoDB, **slaves accept writes**: a slave write synchronises with the master, which propagates it to the other slaves. A write to one slave is not immediately synchronised with all others, so for a brief moment consistency (in the CAP sense) is lost: the cluster is **eventually consistent** and **loses pure ACID** transactions across instances. In CAP terms Neo4j HA is **AP**, and it is presented mainly as a way to **increase read capacity**.\n\nCoordination used to rely on an external **ZooKeeper** ensemble — set unique ids for each coordinator, configure each to talk to the others and to its Neo4j server, start all three, then run each Neo4j server in HA mode with unique ports and point it at the coordinators — which meant a lot of extra administration. Newer versions are **self-managing and self-coordinating**: in a four-node cluster with node 4 offline, node 4 re-enters as a **slave** when it returns, and if master node 1 fails the others elect a new leader without any external service; the old master rejoins as a slave. To reduce the chance of reading stale data, **assign a session to one server**. **Backups** still matter for disaster recovery: neo4j-admin backup takes a **full** backup (a usable copy of the database) from any instance, after which **incremental** backups into the same directory are possible.",

Neo4j has **no native load balancer**: it relies on the load-balancing capabilities of the network infrastructure. Two techniques, plus one special case:\n\n**1. Separate read traffic from write traffic.** Most writes should go to the master, so configure the load balancer to send **writes to the master** and **balance reads across the entire cluster**. In a web application the **HTTP method** often tells them apart: POST, PUT and DELETE may modify server-side resources, GET is side-effect free (server extensions are annotated with @GET and @POST). But the REST API submits **all** Cypher — reads and writes — with POST. Then use a **pair of load balancers**: a *write* load balancer that always targets the master and a *read* load balancer over the whole cluster, and let the application, which knows whether an operation reads or writes, pick the address. Each instance exposes a URI saying whether it is the master (and if not, which instance is), which load balancers can **poll** to route traffic.",

Since every instance holds a **full copy**, route each request to the instance where the needed part of the graph is **probably already cached**. This works when most queries are **graph-local** — they start from specific nodes and traverse the surrounding subgraph — so that queries starting from the same nodes always go to the same instance. How to route consistently depends on the domain: **sticky sessions**, letting the instance that first served a user serve all of that user's later requests, or routing by data characteristics, e.g. requests about one **geographical** area to an instance warmed for it.\n\n**3. Read your own writes.** Writes to the master are immediately consistent, but the cluster as a whole is eventually consistent, so the next load-balanced read may hit a slave that has not received the write yet. Fix: use the same consistent routing to send the **write to the slave that will serve the subsequent read** — one of the few cases where **writing through a slave** makes sense.
