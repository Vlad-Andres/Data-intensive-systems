    short: "Space, performance, geo-locality and redundancy each cap what one node can do.",
    detail:
      "A single machine holds a few terabytes, delivers hundreds of GFLOPS, sits at one point on the globe with the speed of light between it and everyone else, and has no redundancy when it fails. Every one of those is a reason to use several machines.",

    term: "ACID versus BASE",
    short: "Strong guarantees cost synchronisation; weak ones push the problem into your application.",
    detail:
      "ACID is atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. BASE is basically available, soft state and eventual consistency. BASE is faster because it synchronises less, but it gives no consistent view — unusable for banking, and a source of subtle bugs elsewhere. Before choosing BASE, be sure you need the performance, or you will end up reimplementing ACID in the application layer.",

    id: "replication",
    term: "Replication",
    short: "Several sites keep copies of the same data.",
    detail:
      "Replication buys faster retrieval, higher read throughput, tolerance of node failures and better locality. The price is keeping the copies in agreement on every write.",

    term: "Fragmentation",
    short: "A relation r is divided into fragments r₁ … rₙ that together carry enough information to rebuild r.",
    detail:
      "Fragmentation and replication combine freely: a relation is cut into fragments, and the system keeps several identical replicas of each fragment.",

    term: "Horizontal fragmentation",
    short: "Each tuple of r is assigned to one or more fragments — a selection.",
    detail:
      "Fragments are built with selection predicates and put back together with union. This is the same operation as sharding: every machine holds a chunk of the rows.",

    id: "vertical-fragmentation",
    term: "Vertical fragmentation",
    short: "The schema of r is split into smaller schemas — a projection.",
    detail:
      "Every fragment schema must contain a common candidate key (or superkey) so the join back is lossless. Where no natural key is available, a tuple-id — an artificial surrogate added to each fragment — serves as one.",

    short: "Completeness and reconstructability are required; disjointness is optional.",
    detail:
      "**Completeness**: every tuple of r occurs in at least one fragment. **Reconstructability**: r can be recomputed from the fragments — union for horizontal, join for vertical. **Disjointness**: fragments do not overlap; this one is deliberately abandoned once fragmentation is combined with replication.",

    detail:
      "Building all $2^n$ combinations guarantees completeness and disjointness by construction. Mutually exclusive predicates collapse most combinations to the empty set: three faculty predicates give $2^3 = 8$ combinations but only four non-empty fragments, the fourth being the tuples matching none of them.",

    short: "Fragment the second relation along the fragmentation of the first, using a semi-join.",
    detail:
      "Fragmenting two relations on unrelated attributes makes the join graph complete — every fragment of one must meet every fragment of the other, and most of those joins are empty. Deriving the second fragmentation from the first makes the graph fall apart into independent, node-local joins.",

    short: "Deciding which node stores which fragment.",

    term: "Sharding",
    short: "Horizontal fragmentation across the machines of a cluster.",

    term: "Query translation and optimization",
    short: "Translate the query onto fragments, then optimize given where those fragments live.",
    detail:
      "It requires fragmentation transparency and takes two steps: reconstruct the relation from its fragments, then combine that with the algebraic query plan. The optimizer's job is to push selections and projections down into the fragments and to avoid reconstructing anything it does not need.",

    short: "Read from any single replica; write to every replica.",
    detail:
      "Reads are as cheap as they can be, but a write must reach every copy, so it is expensive and fails whenever any replica is unavailable. In quorum terms it is $Q_w = W$ and $Q_r = 1$.",

The first condition forces every read to intersect the latest write; the second stops two writes proceeding at once. Tuning $Q_r$ against $Q_w$ shifts the cost between reads and writes.",

    short: "Linear 2PC, presumed abort, 3PC and consensus protocols.",
    detail:
      "**Linear 2PC** chains the agents: $2(n-1)$ messages instead of $4n$, at higher latency. **Presumed abort** reads a missing log entry as abort, saving log writes and ACKs. **3PC** adds a pre-commit phase that removes the blocking at the cost of a round trip, and is rare in practice. **Paxos and Raft** replicate the coordinator itself, so its crash no longer blocks anyone.",

A **distributed** join re-partitions both tables on the join column first. A **broadcast** join sends the smaller relation to every machine. The last two involve cross-shard communication.",

Greenplum adds both: a **master** node holding the schemas and **segment** nodes holding the data, plus a standby master and mirror segments. `DISTRIBUTED BY` shards across segments (hash or random round-robin); `PARTITION BY` splits data within a segment by list or range, with subpartitioning.",
