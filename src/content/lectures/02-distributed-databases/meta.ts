  summary:
    "One machine runs out of space, speed and redundancy, so the data has to be spread across a cluster — without the user noticing. This lecture covers how a relation is cut into fragments and put back together, how shards and replicas are placed, how a quorum and two-phase commit keep the result correct, and how joins are computed when the rows live on different machines.",

  objectives: [
    "Fragment a relation horizontally and vertically, and say which operator reconstructs it.",
    "Check a fragmentation for completeness, reconstructability and disjointness.",
    "Explain why derived fragmentation turns a complete join graph into node-local joins.",
    "Distinguish fragmentation, replication and location transparency, and rewrite a query plan over fragments.",
    "Pick read and write quorums that satisfy Qr + Qw > W and 2·Qw > W, and say what they guarantee.",
    "Trace two-phase commit through its states and name exactly when an agent blocks.",
    "Choose between co-located, distributed and broadcast joins, and reduce transfer with a semi-join or a Bloom filter.",
    "Describe what Greenplum and MemSQL do, and write a Greenplum distribution and partitioning clause.",
  ],
  takeaways: [
    "Horizontal fragmentation splits tuples (selection, reconstructed by union); vertical fragmentation splits attributes (projection, reconstructed by join on a common key).",
    "A fragmentation must be complete and reconstructable; disjointness is optional and is given up on purpose when replication is added.",
    "Derived fragmentation aligns a second relation with the first via a semi-join, so a complete join graph collapses into independent local joins.",
    "Transparency comes in three flavours — fragmentation, replication and location — and the optimizer needs the first to push selections and projections into fragments.",
    "Quorum consensus with Qr + Qw > W and 2·Qw > W guarantees every read overlaps the latest write; relaxing it gives eventual consistency.",
    "2PC makes a distributed transaction atomic but blocks: an agent in Prepared has surrendered its vote and waits for a coordinator that may be down.",
    "Semi-joins ship only join-column values; a Bloom filter ships bits instead, trading false drops for a much smaller message.",
    "Greenplum DISTRIBUTED BY shards across segments while PARTITION BY splits within a segment; MemSQL shards by primary key and replicates reference tables for broadcast joins.",
