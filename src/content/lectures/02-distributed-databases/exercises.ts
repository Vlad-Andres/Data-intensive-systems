| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2125 | Sokrates | C4 | 226 | Philosophy | 85000 | 1 |

| 2136 | Curie | C4 | 36 | Physics | 95000 | 3 |
| 2137 | Kant | C4 | 7 | Philosophy | 98000 | 1 |

It is fragmented in two stages. First **vertically**:

$\\text{ProfVerw} := \\Pi_{PersNr, Name, Salary, Taxclass}(\\text{Professors})$

$\\text{Profs} := \\Pi_{PersNr, Name, Level, Room, Department}(\\text{Professors})$

Then the fragment Profs is fragmented **horizontally**:

$\\text{TheolProfs} := \\sigma_{Department = \\text{'Theology'}}(\\text{Profs})$

$\\text{PhysikProfs} := \\sigma_{Department = \\text{'Physics'}}(\\text{Profs})$

$\\text{PhiloProfs} := \\sigma_{Department = \\text{'Philosophy'}}(\\text{Profs})$

    select Name, Salary, Level
    from   Professors
    where  salary > 80000;`,

As a tree, bottom up:

    ProfVerw          TheolProfs ∪ PhysikProfs ∪ PhiloProfs
            ⋈ PersNr = PersNr
            σ Salary > 80000
            Π Name, Salary, Level

This is correct but wasteful: the whole relation is reconstructed before a single tuple is filtered away.`,

The two steps:

1. **Push the selection down.** $\\sigma_{Salary > 80000}$ only mentions Salary, which lives in ProfVerw alone, so it moves below the join and straight onto that fragment scan. The horizontal fragments are untouched by it.
2. **Insert additional projections.** Keep the intermediate results as small as possible: the ProfVerw branch needs only PersNr, Name and Salary, and each horizontal fragment needs only PersNr and Level. Note that **Name is redundant** — it is stored in both vertical fragments — so it is projected away on the Profs side and taken from ProfVerw.`,

      title: "Bloom filter join between two servers",
      intro: `Tables **students** and **points** share the key StudNr, and points is stored on a separate server. The query to execute:

    SELECT Name, Bonus FROM Student s, Points p WHERE s.StudNr = p.StudNr;

The administrator uses a Bloom filter to preselect tuples, with the hash function $h(x) = x \\bmod 5$ applied to StudNr.

**Students**

| StudNr | Name | Hash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 27 | Magda | ? |
| 4 | Josef | ? |
| 19 | Erik | ? |
| 95 | Philipp | ? |

**Points**

| StudNr | Bonus | Hash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 27 | ja | ? |
| 16 | nein | ? |
| 25 | nein | ? |
| 95 | ja | ? |`,

Note that 4 and 19 collide on bucket 4 — that is normal and costs nothing here.`,

          solution: `**Bit vector: 10101**

$h(x)$ has five different outputs, so the vector is at minimum 5 bits long. A bit is set when the hash function produced that value at least once. The students hash to $\\{2, 4, 4, 0\\}$, so bits 0, 2 and 4 are set and bits 1 and 3 stay clear.`,

- 27 hashes to 2 — bit set, transferred (and it is a genuine match).
- 16 hashes to 1 — bit clear, filtered out.
- 25 hashes to 0 — bit set, transferred, but there is no student 25: a **false positive**.
- 95 hashes to 0 — bit set, transferred (a genuine match).`,

          hint: "Of the tuples that passed the filter, how many turn out to have no join partner?",
          solution: `Three tuples were transferred and one of them (25) has no join partner, so

$$\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 33\\%$$

The false positive costs bandwidth only — the real join at the other side discards it, so the result stays exact.`,

          solution: `Only the three tuples that pass the filter are shipped, plus the filter itself:

$$3 \\cdot 8 + 1 = 25 \\text{ bytes}$$

A saving of 7 bytes on this toy example — but the ratio is what matters: the filter is a fixed cost while the tuples scale with the size of the relation.`,
