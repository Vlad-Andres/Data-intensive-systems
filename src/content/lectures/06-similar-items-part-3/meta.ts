  summary:
    "Signatures solve the space problem but not the pairs problem. Part 3 follows the second half of the Matching slides with MMDS §3.4 and §3.8.1–§3.8.3: band the signature matrix so that only similar columns are likely to share a bucket, analyse the resulting S-curve, assemble the whole pipeline, and see how real entity resolution adapts the idea to records — scoring, blocking and validating matches without labels.",

  objectives: [
    "Explain how LSH turns all-pairs comparison into a small set of candidate pairs, and what false positives and false negatives are.",
    "Apply the banding technique to a signature matrix and say when two columns become a candidate pair.",
    "Compute the S-curve 1 − (1 − sʳ)ᵇ and the threshold (1/b)^(1/r), and tune b and r for a target similarity.",
    "Lay out the complete pipeline from documents to verified similar pairs.",
    "State what a (d₁, d₂, p₁, p₂)-sensitive family is and how minhashing fits it.",
    "Describe how entity resolution adapts LSH to records: field scoring, blocking, and validating matches without labels.",
    "Name the alternatives to LSH when the required similarity is very high.",
  ],
  takeaways: [
    "LSH hashes items many times so that similar items are likely to share a bucket at least once; only those candidate pairs are evaluated.",
    "Banding splits the signature matrix into b bands of r rows; columns agreeing on all r rows of any one band become candidates.",
    "P[candidate] = 1 − (1 − sʳ)ᵇ: an S-curve with threshold ≈ (1/b)^(1/r). With b = 20 and r = 5, a pair at 0.8 is missed only about once in 3000.",
    "Choose a threshold below the target to avoid false negatives, above it to limit false positives.",
    "The pipeline: shingle → minhash → choose b and r → LSH for candidates → check signatures → optionally check the documents.",
    "A family is (d₁, d₂, p₁, p₂)-sensitive if close points collide with probability ≥ p₁ and far points with ≤ p₂; for minhash, P[h(x) = h(y)] = 1 − d(x, y).",
    "Records need field-aware scoring and blocking; a field outside the score validates matches without labels: f = (45 − x) / 35.",
    "LSH suits relatively low similarities; for very high ones, length filtering and prefix indexing find all pairs exactly.",
