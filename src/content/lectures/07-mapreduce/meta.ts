  summary:
    "When data outgrows one machine, scalable means “can make use of thousands of cheap computers” and “one pass over the data”. MapReduce makes that programmable with two functions: map turns each input into key-value pairs, the system groups them by key, and reduce combines each group. This lecture builds the model from the slides' examples, explains how Hadoop executes a job and survives failures, and works through the algorithms you must be able to write: word count, an inverted index, relational operators and joins, and matrix multiplication.",

  objectives: [
    "Explain what scalable means today and why tasks that must touch every record need parallelism.",
    "Describe the MapReduce programming model: map, grouping by key (shuffle), reduce, and their signatures.",
    "Write map and reduce functions for word count and similar counting tasks, and say when a combiner is allowed.",
    "Describe how a job executes on Hadoop — master, workers, splits, local intermediate files — and how node failures are handled.",
    "Write a MapReduce program that builds an inverted index.",
    "Implement selection, projection, union, intersection, difference, natural join and grouping with MapReduce.",
    "Multiply a matrix by a vector, and two matrices in two steps or one, with MapReduce.",
  ],
  takeaways: [
    "Scalable now means using thousands of cheap computers and getting one pass over the data; an O(N) task over N records on k workers takes O(N/k).",
    "map(in_key, in_value) → list(out_key, intermediate_value); the system groups by key; reduce(out_key, list(intermediate_value)) → list(out_value).",
    "Every key goes to exactly one reducer, so a reducer sees every occurrence of its key regardless of which input it came from.",
    "A combiner runs the reduce function inside map tasks; it is valid when the reduce function is associative and commutative.",
    "The master splits the input into M map tasks and R reduce tasks; map output stays on local disk, so a failed map worker's tasks are redone even if finished; only a master failure restarts the job.",
    "Inverted index: map emits (word, document id), reduce collects the list of documents per word.",
    "Natural join R(A,B) ⋈ S(B,C): map emits (b, (R, a)) and (b, (S, c)); reduce pairs every R value with every S value for that b.",
    "Matrix multiplication: two jobs (join on j, then group by (i, k) and sum) or one job keyed by output cell (i, k) that matches values on j.",
